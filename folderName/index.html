<h2><u>Overview:</u></h2>
<p>
We were challenged with designing, building and testing a miniature satellite to fit inside a regular soft drink can.  We were given the primary mission, which stated that our design had to measure air pressure and ambient temperature and had to develop a secondary mission to investigate or create anything we wanted. We chose to use a wide range of electronic components such as a methane gas sensor, magnetometer, humidity sensor and a GPS module to be able to determine whether volcanoes are active or not and extended this to volcanic activity on other planets. Our chosen mission is highly relevant, primarily due to the great strides that are being made to develop civilisation on Mars.
As part of the design process, we expected to face some issues, but we couldn’t have predicted the barrage of problems we would have to overcome. Despite this, we were able to produce a finished product to launch, something that many teams around the continent weren’t able to do due to the constraints of the pandemic.
Once we had coded, designed, and manufactured our creation, it was time for the launch. We were given the amazing opportunity to go all the way to York to witness our hard work being launched 450m into the sky. We all agreed that it was a fantastic learning opportunity, and due to the brilliant weather conditions, the launch went as expected - the parachute worked perfectly, and our components were safely recovered. We now have important and exciting data to analyse as part of our final report write-up.
We immensely enjoyed the whole competition, run jointly by the European Space Agency and Esero-UK, and the experience allowed us to develop our time and project management skills, learn how to work effectively in a team, and get a feel for project work in an engineering-related career by, for example, talking to engineers from Raptor Aerospace. We are looking forward to doing it all again in the coming year.

<h2><u>Secondary Mission:</u></h2>
<p>
Evidence for biology on extraterrestrial planets can be suggested by methane concentrations being over a certain ‘threshold’ value. Explaining any values higher than this threshold value would be difficult to explain considering the short atmospheric lifespan of CH4.  However, scientists are exploring the possibilities of false positives for methane biosignatures. An alternative source of methane that could be providing these false-positive results is volcanoes. The generation of CH4 in deep-sea hydrothermal vents was used to further investigate the prospects of false-positive CH4 biosignatures. The research concluded that there is a small chance of >10 Tmol CH4 yr−1 however abiotic levels of CH4 on Earth evidence that these estimations are unreasonably large. (Higher levels of CH4 were likely detected because of the following two reasons: catalysed reactions between H2 and Carbon and the biology present. Lab recreations of the reaction between H2 and Carbon showed that uncatalysed, the reaction is extremely slow.)

Data from the Monte Carlo simulations provided evidence for an increased likelihood of volcanic fluxes of CH4 being comparable to biological CH4 fluxes in environments with larger magma production rates. Noticeable changes in CH4 normally corresponded to changes in CO and H2O. Therefore detecting a large concentration of CO in an atmosphere could suggest that high concentrations of CH4 were abiotic, and if not detected, it could suggest the presence of biology. Unfortunately, a CO sensor within the project’s budget and size requirement was unable to be found and so it was decided to use the necessary compromise of a humidity sensor instead. Volcanic activity releases a huge amount of water vapour, and so measuring this would give an indication of the activity of the volcano and whether the CH4 present in the planet’s atmosphere was biotic or abiotic. For example, if as the device nears the volcano methane and water vapour concentration increase, it can be assumed that the methane detected in Mars’ atmosphere is due to volcanic activity. However, if high humidity levels are not detected, it could be assumed that the CH4 concentration in the area exists due to biology. Furthermore, the drone can be equipped with a magnetometer to provide further evidence of volcanic activity (volcanic eruptions can lead to short term changes in magnetic fields which can be detected. These can be caused by fluid vapourisation and stress changes in volcanic rock.)  Rovers may not be able to climb the rocky and potentially steep terrain of a volcano so implementing this technology inside a small rocket or drone is ideal. While drones can not currently fly efficiently in atmospheres as thin as Mars, the technology to do so is being developed at a rapid rate. All of the detectors were small and light enough for the CanSat and so potentially for the drone.
